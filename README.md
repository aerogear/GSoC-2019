AeroGear Google Summer of Code 2020
===================================


## AeroGear organization

This repository contains some information around GSoC 2020 at AeroGear organization.

AeroGear is part of JBoss by Red Hat.

For all JBoss ideas and further GSoC information at JBoss, visit <https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/GSoC2020Ideas>.


## GSoC general information

Google's timeline for GSoC 2020 is here: <https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline>

Please note that student application period starts on 25th March and ends on 9th April.

## Requirements

These are the things students are expected to do:

* Check eligibility at <https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq>
* Introduce yourself to the community via the mailing list: <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/aerogear>
* Either pick one of the ideas at the [ideas page](https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/GSoC2019Ideas) or bring your own project idea
* Show interest in the technology and the products by trying them out and asking questions. Some code on Github and/or a demo would be great.
* JBoss expects students to make a non-trivial contribution before accepting the application. Trying to fix open bugs or working on issues 
  with label "GoodFirstTask" is a good idea. You can check the Github repositories for the issues and bugs.
  
We recommend reading [this](https://medium.com/@i.oleks/how-to-apply-for-google-summer-of-code-95c1bfcd41a5) great document to get some more 
tips for GSoC. 

## Engaging with AeroGear community

Mailing list is the best option to engage with the community. We like offline conversations because of the timezone differences.

For quick queries, you can also use the IRC channel however there is no guarantee that you will get an answer immediately.

We would prefer open communication via the mailing list instead of private communication. For example, if you have a question about an idea
listed in the [ideas page](https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/GSoC2020Ideas), please send a mail to the mailing list instead of contacting
the listed mentor privately.

Also, in general, we would be happy to try help you in any way we can, but you will need to provide some good information. Think of it like opening a 
Github issue. The more information you can provide us with, the more likely someone will be able to help you. 

* Explain what you are trying to do.
* Mention the AeroGear project(s) or other technologies if it is important.
* If you are trying to solve a particular problem, please describe any of the solutions you have tried. Links to example code or documentation would be helpful.
* If you're looking for some extra information or help, please describe it in some more detail.

This is actually valid for all open source communities, not just our own. We would be more than happy to help.

## Expectations from students when they are accepted

After you have done everything in the requirements section above, applied to the program and then accepted by Google; congrats!
We will be very happy to have you in our community!

Here are some things we would expect from you during the coding in the summer:
* Communicate often, ask questions
* Commit your code early and often
* Prepare demos for your work so that the whole community can see the great stuff you develop

## Ideas

We officially has to list ideas in https://docs.jboss.org/display/GSOC/Google+Summer+of+Code+2020+ideas

## Getting started with AeroGear projects

Our recommendation is:

1. Get used to the technologies listed in the idea pages (listed above) for your idea
2. Go through the READMEs of the AeroGear project(s) you're interested in and install, configure and run them on your machine
See projects we maintain: https://github.com/aerogear/graphql-home
3. Try fixing a bug of impelementing a small feature listed for that project in Github issues. You can contact the 
   community via the mailing list to ask for these if you can't find any. 

We also use Github issues for community reported issues. For example Voyager server has some [issues](https://github.com/aerogear/voyager-server/issues) open at the time of writing this document.

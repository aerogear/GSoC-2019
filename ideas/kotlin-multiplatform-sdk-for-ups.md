# Kotlin Multi-platform SDK for Unified Push Server 
 

## Summary of idea:

The goal of this work is to create a multiplatform SDK for Unified Push Server using Kotlin Native. 

See [Multiplatform Projects - Kotlin Programming Language](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html#multiplatform-libraries).

We currently have a separate SDK for Android, iOS, Javascript and Windows. Our aim is to have a single codebase for all of these SDKs.

## Technologies

# Ionic Capacitor integration with AeroGear Voyager
 

## Summary of idea:

Capacitor technology enables smooth transition between Android/IOS and PWA.

Proposed work will require getting familiar with Ionic Capacitor and extending current Ionic Voyager template 
to work with Capacitor Framework. At later phase native implementations for IOS and Android can be done.

 
What is required to work on:

* Basic knowledge of Node.js and TypeScript (participants can learn that)
* Mobile development: IOS/Android is a plus
 

What students will get:

* Familiarity with modern cross platform dev tools (Ionic ecosystem)
* IOS/Android plugin development
 

Challenges:

* All work requires extensive research of Ionic Capacitor.
* Developers can contribute work directly in Capacitor repository and become Ionic collaborator
